## 🎯 What is Pwnsheet?

A smart, interactive cheatsheet designed to streamline penetration testing assessments. Pwnsheet transforms static markdown checklists into a dynamic, browser-based workspace with intelligent parameter management and progress tracking.

## ✨ Key Features

- **📋 Phase-Based Workflow** - Structured assessment phases from reconnaissance through lateral movement
- **🎯 Dynamic Parameters** - Click any code block to filter relevant parameters; auto-populate commands across the entire phase
- **✅ Progress Tracking** - Interactive checkboxes with persistent state to track your assessment progress
- **📦 Zero Dependencies** - Pure HTML/CSS/JS with no build process; runs entirely in the browser
- **💾 Local Storage** - All progress and parameters saved locally; nothing leaves your machine
- **🎨 Modern UI** - Clean, responsive interface optimized for security professionals
- **📱 Mobile Friendly** - Fully responsive design works on tablets and mobile devices
- **⌨️ Keyboard Shortcuts** - `Ctrl/Cmd + R` to reset, quick navigation between phases

## 🚀 Quick Start

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/0x8e5afe/pwnsheet.git
cd pwnsheet

# Start a local server
python3 -m http.server 8000

# Open in browser
# Navigate to http://localhost:8000
```

## 📖 How to Use

### 1. Select a Phase
Click any phase in the left panel to load its checklist:
- Reconnaissance & Enumeration
- Vulnerability Assessment & Web Testing
- Exploitation (Infrastructure & Web)
- Post Exploitation & Privilege Escalation
- Active Directory Exploitation
- Lateral Movement
- Pivoting with Ligolo-ng & Tunneling Strategy

### 2. Work with Parameters
Parameters appear in the right panel when present in a phase. They use the format `<PARAMETER_NAME>` or `{{PARAMETER_NAME}}`:

- **Global Mode** - Fill parameters to auto-populate throughout the entire phase
- **Code Block Mode** - Click any code block to filter only its relevant parameters
- **Search** - Use the search box to quickly find specific parameters

Example workflow:
```bash
# Phase contains: nmap -sV -p- <TARGET_IP>
# Enter 10.10.11.45 in TARGET_IP parameter
# Command auto-updates to: nmap -sV -p- 10.10.11.45
```

### 3. Track Progress
- Check off completed tasks as you go
- All checkbox states persist between sessions
- Use the Reset button to start a fresh assessment

### 4. Copy Commands
- Hover over any code block to reveal the copy button
- Comments (lines starting with `#`) are automatically stripped when copying
- Code blocks highlight when selected for parameter filtering
