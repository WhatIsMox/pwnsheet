## 🎯 What is Pwnsheet?

A smart, interactive cheatsheet designed to streamline penetration testing assessments. Pwnsheet transforms static markdown checklists into a dynamic, browser-based workspace with intelligent parameter management and progress tracking.

## ✨ Key Features

Everything follows an interactive, dynamic approach—helpers react to your inputs and keep commands in sync.

- **📋 Phase-Based Workflow** - Cheatsheet for all pentesting phases from reconnaissance to lateral movement
- **🎯 Dynamic Parameters** - Click any code block to filter relevant parameters; auto-populate commands across the assessment
- **✅ Progress Tracking** - Interactive checkboxes with persistent state to track your assessment progress
- **📦 Zero Dependencies** - Pure HTML/CSS/JS with no build process; runs entirely in the browser
- **💾 Local Storage** - All progress and parameters saved locally; nothing leaves your machine
- **🎨 Modern UI** - Clean, responsive interface optimized for security professionals
- **🚚 File Transfer Helper** - Generates sender/receiver commands for faster file moves across hosts
- **🐚 Shells Helper** - Reverse shell oneliners, web shells, and stabilization commands on demand
- **🧰 Tools & Wordlists Table** - Quick download/install commands for common tools and wordlists
- **📝 Skeleton Notes Downloader** - Grab templated markdown notes to capture findings during assessments

## 🚀 Quick Start

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/0x8e5afe/pwnsheet.git
cd pwnsheet

# Start a local server
python3 -m http.server 8000

# Open in browser
# Navigate to http://localhost:8000
```

## 📖 How to Use

### 1. Select a Phase
Click any phase in the left panel to load its checklist:
- Reconnaissance & Enumeration
- Vulnerability Assessment & Web Testing
- Exploitation (Infrastructure & Web)
- Post Exploitation & Privilege Escalation
- Active Directory Exploitation
- Lateral Movement
- Pivoting with Ligolo-ng & Tunneling Strategy

### 2. Work with Parameters
Parameters appear in the right panel when present in a phase. They use the format `<PARAMETER_NAME>` or `{{PARAMETER_NAME}}`:

- **Global Mode** - Fill parameters to auto-populate throughout the entire phase
- **Code Block Mode** - Click any code block to filter only its relevant parameters
- **Search** - Use the search box to quickly find specific parameters

Example workflow:
```bash
# Phase contains: nmap -sV -p- <TARGET_IP>
# Enter 10.10.11.45 in TARGET_IP parameter
# Command auto-updates to: nmap -sV -p- 10.10.11.45
```

### 3. Track Progress
- Check off completed tasks as you go
- All checkbox states persist between sessions
- Use the Reset button to start a fresh assessment

### 4. Copy Commands
- Simply highlight the piece of code in a snippet to copy it
